Gay coffee shop owner kicks Christians out of cafe, goes on vulgar rant — it was all caught on video
A Seattle, Washington coffee shop owner kicked a group of Christians out of his shop last week because their presence was “offensive” to him. 
What were they doing there?
The group had been handing out booklets to Seattle citizens which addressed sin, the Bible, and abortion. 
According to The Liberator, the group decided to take a break and stop for coffee at nearby coffee shop, Bedlam Coffee. 
The site reported that one of the baristas told the owner what the Christian group had been doing outside on the streets of Seattle, and he didn’t take it well. 
What did he say?
The owner, in the video, approaches the Christian group and tells them they have to leave. 
“I’m gay, you have to leave,” he said. “This is offensive to me. I own the place. I have the right to be offended.” 
The group attempted to tell the owner that they hadn’t left any of their pamphlets in his shop, but the owner wasn’t hearing any of it. 
Repeatedly telling them to “shut up,” the owner said, “There’s nothing you can say. This is you and I don’t want these people in this place.” 
The Christians pressed the owner as to why he is so opposed to their presence in the shop, and that’s when things got extraordinarily vulgar. 
“Can you tolerate my presence? Really?” the owner asked. “If I go get my boyfriend and f**k him in the a** right here you’re going to tolerate that? Are you going to tolerate it?”
Becoming increasingly agitated, the owner yelled, “Answer my f***ing question! No, you’re going to sit right here and f***ing watch it! Leave, all of you! Tell all your f**king friends don’t come here!”
As the group begins collecting their belongings to leave, one of the women in the group addresses the owner directly and tells him, “Just know that Christ can save you from that lifestyle.” 
“Yeah, I like a**,” the owner spat. “I’m not going to be saved by anything. I’d f**k Christ in the a**. Okay? He’s hot.”
As the group left the shop, one of the women in the group told the owner that she would be praying for him. 
The video, shared by Facebook account Abolish Human Abortion, has received over 400 views at the time of this writing.

Two high school football players learn ultimate lesson from coach after they protest national anthem
Two high school football players in Texas learned a hard lesson Friday after they protested the national anthem before a school game.
What happened?
According to the Houston Chronicle, Cedric Ingram-Lewis and his cousin Larry McCullough were kicked off the football team at Victory & Praise Christian Academy after they protested during the anthem on Friday. Ingram-Lewis raised his fist in protest, while McCullough kneeled.
Who made the decision to dismiss them?
Directly following the anthem, their head coach, Ronnie Mitchem, told the sophomore and senior players to take off their jerseys and immediately dismissed them from the team. The Chronicle noted that Mitchem is a former Marine and a pastor.
Why did they get dismissed?
Ingram-Lewis explained after the protest that Mitchem had told the team no protests would be “tolerated.”
Mitchem, however, told the Chronicle his two players left him with no choice, and explained he thought he had a deal with his players that none would protest. He said: “Like I said, I’m a former Marine. That just doesn’t fly and they knew that. I don’t have any problem with those young men. We’ve had a good relationship. They chose to do that and they had to pay for the consequences.”
Mitchem said he supported the players and their protest, but not the method or place. Instead, he thought the players could have kneeled after scoring a touchdown or passed out fliers about their plight.
What did the parents think?
Rhonda Brady, Ingram-Lewis’ mother and McCullough’s aunt, told the Chronicle she supported her son and nephew, but explained the coach’s swift decision was perplexing.
She said: “I’m definitely going to have a conversation because I don’t like the way that that was handled. But I don’t want them back on the team. A man with integrity and morals and ethics and who truly lives by that wouldn’t have done anything like that. Actions speak louder than words. So, for him to do what he did, that really spoke volumes and I don’t want my kids or my nephew to be around a man with no integrity.”



http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/05/atheist-group-demands-hs-marching-band-stop-its-religious-show-but-the-school-isnt-backing-down
Atheist group demands HS marching band stop its ‘religious’ show. But the school isn’t backing down.
The Freedom from Religion Foundation — a national atheist activist group — has demanded that an Alabama high school marching band stop its “religious” halftime performances at football games, AL.com reported.
What is the atheist group upset about?
The FFRF said the Leeds High School marching band’s show resembles a Christian church service, with church pews set up on the football field.
In addition, the band plays hymns such as “Will the Circle be Unbroken,” “I Saw the Light,” “Swing Low Sweet Chariot,” “Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee” and “Amazing Grace,” AL.com reported.
“Seeing the pews on the field with little crosses on them … was really more than them showing religious music,” Chris Line, an FFRF legal fellow, told WBMA-TV. “It was clearly meant to evoke a Christian worship service that you’ll see on Sunday in a church.”
The FFRF sent a letter to the district that the show violates the separation of church and state, noting that public schools can’t “advance or promote religion,” the outlet added.
FFRF officials told AL.com a “concerned local parent” contacted them about the issue and claimed the band director told band members who don’t support the show that they can “drop out of band.”
“The band director’s actions are way over the line,” FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor told the outlet. “In a secular setup, he cannot be permitted to foist his religion on others.”
How is the school reacting?
“We have submitted the FFRF’s complaint to the [school] Board’s attorney for review,” Leeds City Schools Superintendent John J. Moore told AL.com. “We do not have plans to stop the show.”
Leeds High School Principal Brent Shaw added to WBMA that the show is “not meant in any way to offend anyone or try to convert anybody to Christianity.”
Shaw added to the station that his students worked hard on their performance, and the school will consider removing some of the props — but that the show will otherwise remain the same.
A complaint letter from the Freedom from Religion Foundation led to a ban on student-led prayer over the loudspeaker before football games at Alabama’s Smiths Station High School — but late last month ended up praying without amplification anyway.

Leonardo DiCaprio says only people who believe in science should hold public office
Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio said last week that an aspiring politician who doesn’t believe in science should not be allowed to hold public office — but many on social media were quick to question what “science” DiCaprio is referring to and which scientific facts count.
What did he say?
While speaking at Yale University last week, DiCaprio vilified President Donald Trump from withdrawing the United State from the Paris Agreement on climate change.
According to the Hartford Courant, he said: “We are going to look back at this point in history, and frankly this administration, and certain people are going to be vilified for not taking action. We should not have people in office who do not believe in facts and truths and modern science that are able to manipulate and risk the entire future of this entire generation.”
But what is “science?”
To DiCaprio, an ardent liberal and progressive, to “believe in facts and truths and modern science” is to believe that human activity is actively destroying our planet via climate change and global warming. 
DiCaprio’s science doesn’t include all science, however, like the fact that life begins at conception or that humans have only two biological genders. And people were quick to call him on it:
Others thought DiCaprio was being hypocritical because his statement resembled a religious litmus test:



http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/12/sean-hannitys-advertisers-are-bailing-on-him-but-its-whos-behind-the-exodus-is-the-real-story
Sean Hannity’s advertisers are bailing on him — but it’s who’s behind the exodus is the real story
Some of the companies that sponsor Fox News host Sean Hannity are distancing themselves from the Republican commentator after a controversial radio interview with Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R) last week, in addition to comments Hannity made on his Fox News program.
What’s going on?
Hannity, who also hosts one of the most listened to talk radio shows in the country, had Moore on his radio program on Friday to discuss the allegations being charged at him. The Washington Post broke a bombshell story last Thursday, alleging that Moore has a history of sexual abuse and dating teenagers. Moore has denied all allegations.
Moore told Hannity that he didn’t “generally” remember dating any teenagers “without the permission of her mother” when he was in his 30s. Moore maintained his innocence and said he believes the “attacks” against him are politically motivated.
Hannity, who is typically soft on Trump supporters and Republicans, was later praised for the “tough” interview.
So why the advertiser exodus?
People are mad because Hannity urged his viewers on Fox last Thursday to not rush to judgement in the Moore scandal.
“Every single person in this country deserves the presumption of innocence,” Hannity said. “With the allegations against Judge Moore, none of us know the truth of what happened 38 years ago. The only people that would know are the people involved in this incident.”
The advice was not well received by some, who began tweeting at Hannity’s sponsors. Some of the sponsors have pulled advertising in the wake of the criticism.
Which companies?
Coffee maker giant Keurig confirmed they pulled their ads on Twitter Saturday in response to someone who accused Hannity of defending a “child molester.” At no time did Hannity defend Moore, and instead said Moore should step aside if the allegations are true.
Who’s behind the effort? Is there any significance?
While it is mostly liberals targeting Hannity’s advertisers, Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, is the most prominent figure behind the social media targeting. Media Matters, which is financed by billionaire liberal George Soros, has previously targeted Hannity’s advertisers and tried to get him booted from Fox — but they failed.



http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/04/michael-moore-proposes-change-to-constitution-that-repeals-the-ancient-and-outdated-2nd-amendment
Michael Moore proposes change to Constitution that ‘repeals the ancient and outdated 2nd Amendment’
Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore took a detour Wednesday morning from his campaign to evict Republican President Donald Trump from office and set his sights on gun rights.
In the wake of the deadly Las Vegas mass shooting Sunday night, Moore proposed a 28th amendment to the United States Constitution that “repeals the ancient and outdated 2nd Amendment.”
He began his lengthy Facebook post with the following preamble:
“A well regulated State National Guard, being helpful to the safety and security of a State in times of need, along with the strictly regulated right of the people to keep and bear a limited number of non-automatic Arms for sport and hunting, with respect to the primary right of all people to be free from gun violence, this shall not be infringed.”
Moore — noting the Second Amendment was “written before bullets and revolvers were even invented” — said his proposed amendment “guarantees States can have State militias (a.k.a. State National Guards which are made up of citizen-soldiers who are called upon in times of natural disasters or other State emergencies), allows individuals to use guns for sport and gathering food, and guarantees everyone the right to be free of, and protected from, gun violence (i.e., the public’s safety comes ahead of an individual’s right to own and fire a gun).”
What else does Moore’s proposed amendment say?
“As over 90% of gun violence is committed by men, in order for a man to purchase a gun, he must first get a waiver from his current wife, plus his most recent ex-wife, or any woman with whom he is currently in a relationship (if he’s gay, he must get the waiver from his male spouse/partner),” he wrote. “This law has greatly reduced most spousal/domestic gun murders in Canada.”
“All automatic and semi-automatic guns are banned,” Moore added.
“No gun or clip can hold more than 6 bullets,” he continued.
Moore said a gun’s trigger must recognize the registered owner’s fingerprint. “This will eliminate most crimes committed with a gun as 80% of these crimes are done with a stolen gun,” he added.
No guns at home, Moore said. Instead they must “be stored at a licensed gun club or government-regulated gun storage facility. Believing that having a gun in your home provides you with protection is an American myth. People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04% of all gun murders in the US. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them.”
Moore said all who “own and operate” guns must get licenses “like one does to operate a car” and “complete a gun training and safety course and pass a thorough background check” before getting licensed.
“As nearly half of all gun deaths are suicides, mental health care must become a top national health priority and must be properly funded,” he added. “And by making it more difficult to purchase a gun — and requiring its storage outside the home — easy access during a suicidal moment is denied.”
More also wants the removal of “current restrictions placed on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), due to successful lobbying by the NRA” to study “the gun violence epidemic in the US.” He added that “science will then be free to find out why we are ALONE among nations in killing each other at such a massive rate (hint: It’s not just the guns — it’s us as Americans).”
What other conclusions does Moore draw?
“This is the sane approach that meets everyone’s needs,” he wrote, “everyone, that is, except those of the serial killer, the mass murderer, the violent ex-husband, the disgruntled employee or the disturbed and bullied teenager.”
Moore said it won’t “deny hunters and sportsmen their fun.”
He added, “We can start with the upcoming midterm election. Let every candidate know: If you take NRA money, we will remove you from office.”

Pittsburgh Steelers stay in locker room during national anthem — then teammate takes defiant stand
Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said Sunday morning that his entire team would stay in the locker room during the national anthem to help his players avoid politics. But one player stood outside the tunnel for a very good reason.
What happened?
While dozens of NFL players took a knee during the national anthem in protest on Sunday, the Steelers stayed in their locker room. Just prior to the anthem, the Steelers’ sideline was deserted. And then one player emerged from the Steelers’ tunnel: Left tackle Alejandro Villanueva.
His fellow football players made statements by taking a knee. But Villanueva chose to make a much different statement. He emerged from the tunnel, helmet in hand, put his hand over his heart and stood in reverence while the national anthem played in Chicago’s Solider Field.
What sets Villanueva apart?
Most professional football players get to the league by being a standout in college. But Villanueva had a much different career path, one that made his decision on Sunday very easy.
Before playing in the NFL, Villanueva served in the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of captain. He served three tours of duty in Afghanistan and even earned a Bronze Star for recusing injured soldiers while under enemy fire. He graduated from West Point and joined the Army Rangers late in his military career.
What has Villanueva said about the protests before?
Last August, when Colin Kaepernick initiated the protests, Villanueva said, according to SB Nation:
I don’t know if the most effective way is to sit down during the national anthem with a country that’s providing you freedom, providing you $16 million a year … when there are black minorities that are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan for less than $20,000 a year.
But he was also quick to acknowledge the problems that Kaepernick was working to highlight:
I will be the first one to hold hands with Colin Kaepernick and do something about the way minorities are being treated in the United States, the injustice that is happening with police brutality, the justice system, inequalities in pay. You can’t do it by looking away from the people that are trying to protect our freedom and our country.

Boston Marathon Explosions Already Being Blamed on the Right
Before any information was available that might indicate who is responsible for the horrific Boston Marathon bombings, Esquire’s Charles P. Pierce cautioned readers against “jumping to conclusions” and blaming the attack on “foreign terrorism.”
However, he was compelled to remind people that Monday is the “official Patriots Day holiday” in Massachusetts, celebrating the Battles at Lexington and Concord. He also pointed out that April 19, the actual date of the battles, is connected to Oklahoma City bomber Tim McVeigh, who apparently considered himself a “waterer of the tree of liberty and the like,” according to Pierce.
“I’ll bet good money it’s a right-wing nutjob. Today is April 15, Boston Harbor was where the original Tea Party took place and the on-going gun-safety legislation makes it the mostly likely culprit,” commenter Linda Ginsburg wrote.
Other commenters replied by calling Ginsburg an “idiot” and “disgusting.”
TheBlaze cautions readers from blaming ANY group or individual until more information is known.
Additionally, CNN’s Peter Bergen said “first reports are often erroneous” but added he would be looking into what type of bomb was used to determine who might be behind the suspected attack.
“If it was hydrogen peroxide, this is sort of a signature of al-Qaeda. If it was more conventional explosives, which are much harder to get a hold of now, that might be another kind of right-wing extremism,” he said.
While Bergen does suggest that radical Islamic terrorism could be behind the attack, he singles out “right-wing extremism” as a possibility without speculating that left-wing extremist groups like Occupy Wall Street could be behind the explosions. He does not, however, explicitly blame “right-wing extremism.”
Watch the video via CNN below:
Huffington Post blogger and Al Sharpton’s radio producer Nida Khan also speculated that “all these anti-gov groups” could be behind the explosions.
“We don’t know anything yet of course, but it is tax day & my first thought was all these anti-gov groups, but who knows,” Khan tweeted.
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof used the Boston Marathon explosions to take a shot at Republican lawmakers.
“explosion is a reminder that ATF needs a director. Shame on Senate Republicans for blocking apptment,” he tweeted.
He quickly backtracked and deleted his tweet after people criticized him for the ridiculous connection. “People jumping on me for criticizing Sen Repubs for blocking ATF appointments. ok, that was low blow. i take it back,” he tweeted.
Appearing on ABC Monday, former FBI agent Brad Garrett said it wouldn’t surprise him if the suspected bombing was conducted by a domestic extremist group trying to make a statement. He said there have been a number of “domestic extremist events” carried out from the dates April 15-20, including the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine and Virginia Tech.
He went on to say that a “neo Nazi or a patriot group” are not going to come forward immediately to claim responsibility. He also said it might be an individual not a group behind the explosions.
“There’s a lot of public source information about demonstrations on taxes, on a number of other issues that are hot button issues for extremists groups who don’t like either what the government is doing or what the government represents,” he explained.

See how NFL players responded to Trump’s attack on national anthem protests before game in London
In the first game since President Donald Trump’s controversial remarks about national anthem protests, NFL players responded with defiance.
What happened?
More than two dozen players between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens kneeled in protest Sunday during the national anthem before a game played in London. The number of players participating in the protests was much more than normal, and were spurred by comments Trump made on Friday about the protests.
For those who didn’t protest, each player, coach, and team staff member locked arms on the sidelines during the anthem. Even Jaguars owner Shad Khan stood on the sidelines in solidarity with his team and the NFL.
What did Trump say and what has the fallout been?
Speaking at a rally in Alabama Friday, Trump said: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag, to say get that son of a b***h off the field right now?”
He also characterized the protests as “total disrespect of our heritage” and “total disrespect of everything that we stand for.”
The backlash was immediate and swift. Athletes from every sport, including NBA greats Lebron James and Steph Curry, denounced the comments. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and NFL owners condemned Trump, and the vast majority of Americans condemned the comments.
The left condemned them because Trump harshly denounced what they believe is a very important issue, while many on the right condemned the comments because they encroached on the players’ right to speech and protest.
In response, players said the protests would continue and be magnified. Even one major league baseball player found himself on a knee Saturday during the anthem.
What to expect for the rest of Sunday
As games continue to kickoff on Sunday, expect more and more players to kneel during the national anthem. Activist Shaun King said he has talked to dozens of NFL players and hundreds have confirmed their plans to protest on Sunday.

Trump responds to San Juan mayor after she excoriates him for government response in Puerto Rico
San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz tore into the Trump administration on Friday over their response to utter destruction in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricane Maria. On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump responded to the mayor.
What did the mayor say?
Speaking on CNN, Yulín Cruz responded specifically to comments that Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke made when she called response efforts a “good news story.” Yulín Cruz said:
Is that what [she said]? Well, maybe from where she’s standing it’s a good news story.
When you’re drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story. When you don’t have food for a baby, it’s not a good news story. I’m sorry, but that really upsets me and frustrates me. Frankly, it’s an irresponsible statement, and at contrast with the statements of support that I’ve been getting since yesterday, when I got that call from the White House.
Dammit, this is not a good news story. This is a “people are dying” story. This is a life or death story.
This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water. It is not a good news story when people are dying. Where is there good news here. I’m really sorry, but when you have people out there dying, literally, scraping for food — where is the good news?
How did Trump respond?
Trump took to his personal Twitter account to respond to the frustrated mayor:
Will Trump visit Puerto Rico?
After Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas earlier this year, Trump made several trips to the Lone Star State to tour the damaged areas and assist with relief efforts. Is he planning on doing the same for Puerto Rico? He confirmed on Twitter Saturday that he and first lady Melania Trump plan to head to the island on Tuesday — and maybe even the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Chris Matthews bewildered that some say constitutional rights come from God
MSNBC’s Chris Matthews expressed shock and dismay that some actually believed that their constitutional rights preceded the Constitution, and came from God.
What did he say?
Matthews tried to paint the traditional view of the source of our constitutional rights as extremist and radical on his show Thursday night. 
“Well, you know what the Republicans say in their platform? That the right to bear arms precedes the Constitution!” he exclaimed. 
“It’s a God-given, sort of theological right,” he continued, “they treat this like religion, Governor, I don’t know how to explain it.” 
“It’s a religious essential notion to them that everybody should have any kind of gun they want!” he continued. “A bazooka, a tank, they never put a limit on it, ever!”
Is he right?
No. He’s not. 
The Declaration of Independence and other writings by the founders make it painfully clear that this was a reasonable and widespread view of the source of our rights. Others have argued that if our rights do not inhere in an unmoving principle, and are only “granted” by government, that they are hardly essential, and could be changed or dissolved at a whim by a capricious government. 
Is this an MSNBC thing?
It appears so. Chuck Todd made similar comments and was excoriated on social media for the criticism of a view that has been mainstream for hundreds of years.

Green Bay Packers ask fans to show solidarity with NFL before Thursday night’s game
The Green Bay Packers released a statement Tuesday asking their fans to participate in their showing of support for the recent NFL #TakeaKnee protests before Thursday night’s game at Lambeau Field.
What are they asking fans to do?
The Packers made clear their intention to lock arms in unity on the field before their game against the Chicago Bears, and asked their fans to do the same.
“Join us this Thursday by locking arms with whoever you’re with, stranger or loved one, wherever you are — intertwined and included — in this moment of unification,” the statement said.
What are they showing support for specifically?
The Packers statement said they stand in unity for freedom, equality, tolerance, and justice, and stand against discrimination.
“The image you will see on September 28th will be one of unity. It will represent a coming together of players who want the same things that all of us do — freedom, equality, tolerance, understanding, and justice for those who have been unjustly treated, discriminated against or otherwise treated unfairly,” the players said in the news release.
“You will see the sons of police officers, kids who grew up in military families, people who have themselves experienced injustice and discrimination firsthand, and an array of others all linking together in a display of unity,” the statement added.
Read the full statement below:
The NFL family is one of the most diverse communities in the world. Just look around! The eclectic group of players that you root for, the coaches you admire, the people you sit next to in the stands, those high-fiving on military bases, fans at the sports bar or during tailgate parties — we all come from different walks of life and have unique backgrounds and stories.
The game of football brings people together. As NFL players, we are a living testimony that individuals from different backgrounds and with different life experiences can work together toward a common goal.
This Thursday during the national anthem at Lambeau Field, Packers players, coaches and staff will join together with arms intertwined — connected like the threads on your favorite jersey. When we take this action, what you will see will be so much more than just a bunch of football players locking arms. The image you will see on September 28th will be one of unity. It will represent a coming together of players who want the same things that all of us do — freedom, equality, tolerance, understanding, and justice for those who have been unjustly treated, discriminated against or otherwise treated unfairly. You will see the sons of police officers, kids who grew up in military families, people who have themselves experienced injustice and discrimination firsthand, and an array of others all linking together in a display of unity.
Those of us joining arms on Thursday will be different in so many ways, but one thing that binds us together is that we are all individuals who want to help make our society, our country and our world a better place. We believe that in diversity there can be UNI-versity. Intertwined, we represent the many people who helped build this country, and we are joining together to show that we are ready to continue to build.
Let’s work together to build a society that is more fair and just.
Join us this Thursday by locking arms with whoever you’re with, stranger or loved one, wherever you are—intertwined and included—in this moment of unification.
— The Packers Players
Another team also made a statement
The Dallas Cowboys made a similar statement Monday night when the team and owner Jerry Jones knelt briefly to show support for the recent players protests, then stood and locked arms during the national anthem. Read more on this.

Police Chief Bans Officers From Denny’s After Manager Tells Detective to Leave Her Gun in the Car or Leave
Gun sensitivity is certainly on the rise. And if you needed an example, look no further than Belleville, Ill., where a battle is brewing between local police officers and a Denny’s Restaurant after an on-duty detective who went inside was told that she either had to leave her firearm in the car or exit the establishment. In addition to voicing outrage at the alleged treatment, the Belleville police chief has since banned officers from eating at the diner.
The drama unfolded on New Year’s Day when the detectives were eating at the Denny’s. The restaurant’s manager came over to tell a female in the group that she had to take her gun to the car or leave. Her request was purportedly based on a complaint from another customer. While, at first, the detectives assumed that the mandate was a joke, they quickly learned otherwise.
The manager explained the Denny’s only allows officers in uniform to carry guns, however the detectives had shown their badges, thus substantiating their identities. When they got up to leave, a general manager, who purportedly noticed the officers refusing to pay for their meals during the dispute, came over and told them that they could stay after all. But the damage was done.
The detectives, feeling embarrassed, decided to leave anyway. Belleville Police Capt. Don Sax condemned the employee’s treatment of the group in a statement to Fox News’ Todd Starnes.
“The Belleville Police Department is very disheartened by the lack of respect shown to on-duty sworn police officers,” he said. “Until further notice all on duty Belleville Police officers are banned from Denny’s Restaurant unless responding to an official call for service.”
To clear up the situation, a Denny’s spokesperson said that the manager making the initial request was wrong and that police in or out of uniform may carry weapons in the company’s restaurants. The spokesperson dismissed the incident as “miscommunication” and said that the manager was simply trying to do the right thing to address another customer’s complaints.
